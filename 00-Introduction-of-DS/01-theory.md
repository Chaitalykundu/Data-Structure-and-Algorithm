# Introduction

- Datas are simply values or set of values

- A **data item** refers to a single unit of values

- Data items that are divided into sub items are called **Group items**

- **An entity** is something that has certain attributes or properties which may be assigned values. That may be either numeric or non-numeric.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

# Definition of Data Structure

**Data structure is a particular way of organizing data in a computer so that it can be used effectively.**

The idea is to reduce the space and time complexities of different tasks.

It allows to understand the **organization of data** and the **management of the data flow** to increase any program's efficiency.

&nbsp;

A data structure is not only used for organizing the data. It is also used for **processing**, **retrieving**, and **storing** data.

&nbsp;

# Need Of Data structure

- Data structure modification is easy.
- It requires less time.
- Save storage memory space.
- Data representation is easy.
- Easy access to the large database

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

# Classification of Data Structures

The Data Structure can be classified into **two** categories:

- Primitive Data Structure
- Non-Primitive Data Structure
  - Linear Data Structure
  - Non-Linear Data Structure

&nbsp;

# Primitive Data Structure

Primitive Data Structure contains fundamental data types such as integer, float, character, pointer, and these fundamental data types can hold a single type of value.

Primitive Data Structures are integer, real, character, boolean.

&nbsp;

# Non-Primitive Data Structure

The non-primitive data structure is a kind of data structure that can hold multiple values either in a contiguous or random location.

Non-Primitive Data Structure is divided into two parts.

1. Linear Data Structures
2. Non-Linear Data Structures

&nbsp;

# Linear Data Structures

A data structure is said to be linear if it's elements are arranged sequentially or linearly.

Every element in the linear data structure is attached to its previous and next adjacent elements.

In Linear DS, Elements are arranged in one dimension.

&nbsp;

# Non-Linear Data Structure

A data structure is said to be non-linear if it's elements are not arranged in sequence.

Elements are arranged in one-many, many-one and many-many dimensions.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

# Applications of Data Structures

Data structures are used in various fields such as:

- Operating system
- Graphics
- Computer Design
- Blockchain
- Genetics
- Image Processing
- Simulation etc.
