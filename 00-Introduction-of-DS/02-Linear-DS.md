# Linear Data Structures

A data structure is said to be linear if it's elements are arranged sequentially or linearly.

Every element in the linear data structure is attached to its previous and next adjacent elements.

In Linear DS, Elements are arranged in one dimension.

# Example

Some of the most common linear data structures include:

- **Arrays**: A collection of elements stored in contiguous memory locations.

- **Linked Lists**: A collection of nodes, each containing an element and a reference to the next node.

- **Stacks**: A collection of elements with Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) order.

- **Queues**: A collection of elements with First-In-First-Out (FIFO) order.

# Operations on Linear DS

- **<u>Traversal</u>** : Processing / visiting each element in the list.

- **<u>Insertion</u>** : Add new element(s) in the list.

- **<u>Deletion</u>** : Delete element(s) from the list.

- **<u>Searching</u>** : Finding the location of any element.

- **<u>Sorting</u>** : Arrange elements in some types of order.

- **<u>Merging</u>** : Combining two lists into a single list

# Characteristics of Linear Data Structure

- **Sequential Organization**: In linear data structures, data elements are arranged sequentially, one after the other. Each element has a unique predecessor (except for the first element) and a unique successor (except for the last element)

- **Order Preservation**: The order in which elements are added to the data structure is preserved. This means that the first element added will be the first one to be accessed or removed, and the last element added will be the last one to be accessed or removed.

- **Fixed or Dynamic Size**: Linear data structures can have either fixed or dynamic sizes. Arrays typically have a fixed size when they are created, while other structures like linked lists, stacks, and queues can dynamically grow or shrink as elements are added or removed.

- **Efficient Access**: Accessing elements within a linear data structure is typically efficient. For example, arrays offer constant-time access to elements using their index.
