| Algorithm          | A set of step-by-step instructions to solve a specific problem.                                                                                                                                                          |
| Data Structure     | A way of organizing data so it can be used efficiently. Common data structures include arrays, linked lists, and binary trees.                                                                                           |
| Time Complexity    | A measure of the amount of time an algorithm takes to run, depending on the amount of data the algorithm is working on.                                                                                                  |
| Space Complexity   | A measure of the amount of memory an algorithm uses, depending on the amount of data the algorithm is working on.                                                                                                        |
| Big O Notation     | A mathematical notation that describes the limiting behavior of a function when the argument tends towards a particular value or infinity. Used in this tutorial to describe the time complexity of an algorithm.        |
| Recursion          | A programming technique where a function calls itself.                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Divide and Conquer | A method of solving complex problems by breaking them into smaller, more manageable sub-problems, solving the sub-problems, and combining the solutions. Recursion is often used when using this method in an algorithm. |
| Brute Force        | A simple and straight forward way an algorithm can work by simply trying all possible solutions and then choosing the best one.                                                                                          |
