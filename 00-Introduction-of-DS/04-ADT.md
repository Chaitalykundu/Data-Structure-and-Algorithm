# ADT

ADT Stands for Abstract Data Type

ADT refers to a set if data values and associated operations that are specified accurately, but it doesn't have any implementation details.

## Abstract view and implementation view of an android phone

| Abstract view       | Implementation view |

# Note

- ADT only mentions what operations are to be performed, but not how these operations will be implemented.

- It doesn't specify how data will be organized in memory and what algo will be used for implementing the operations.

- ADT is called abstract because it gives an implementation independent view.

- The Process of providing only the essentials and hiding the details is known as abstract.
