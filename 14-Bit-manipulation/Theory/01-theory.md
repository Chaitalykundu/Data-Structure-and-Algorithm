# Bit

A **bit** (binary digit) is the smallest unit of data that a computer can process and store.

&nbsp;

Two values represent it as follows -

- 0 - It indicates the signal is absent or False
- 1 - It indicates the signal is present or True

Bits represent the **logical state** of any instruction.

&nbsp;

The series of bits have a base which is 2. Thus if we say if we have a series of binary digits, it is read from left to right, and the power of 2 increases.

&nbsp;

# Bit manipulation

**Bit manipulation** is defined as performing some basic operations on bit level of n number of digits.

Bit Manipulation is a technique in computer programming where operations are performed on individual bits of binary numbers.

It is a speedy and primitive method as it directly works at the machine end.

# Why Learn Bit Manipulation?

- ***<u>Efficiency</u>***: Bit manipulation operations are extremely fast, as they directly interact with the bits of numbers at the hardware level.

- ***<u>Compactness</u>***: Useful for memory optimization (e.g., storing multiple values or states in a single variable).

- ***<u>Problem-Solving</u>***: Many coding challenges and interview questions involve bit manipulation techniques.

# Use Cases

- Checking if a number is even or odd.
- Swapping values without a temporary variable.
- Finding subsets efficiently.
- Checking or setting specific bits.
- Check unpaired value

&nbsp;

# Binary Representation

- A binary number consists of only two digits: **0 and 1**.

- Each digit in binary is called a **bit**


- In JavaScript, numbers are stored as 64-bit floating-point numbers, but for bitwise operations, they are treated as 32-bit signed integers.
