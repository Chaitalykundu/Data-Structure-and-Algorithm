# Common Bit Manipulation Operations

| Operator                | Symbol | Description                                                                                                                                                              | Return Value                                                   |
| ----------------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| <u>**Bitwise AND**</u>  | &      | Performs a logical AND operation on each pair of corresponding bits.                                                                                                     | The result is 1 only if both bits are 1, otherwise, it is 0.   |
| <u>**Bitwise OR**</u>   | \|     | Performs a logical OR operation on each pair of corresponding bits.                                                                                                      | The result is 1 if at least one bit is 1, otherwise, it is 0.  |
| <u>**Bitwise XOR**:</u> | ^      | Performs a logical XOR (exclusive OR) operation on each pair of corresponding bits.                                                                                      | The result is 1 if the bits are different, otherwise, it is 0. |
| <u>**Bitwise NOT**</u>  | ~      | Flips the bits of the operand                                                                                                                                            | 0 to 1 and 1 to 0.                                             |
| <u>**Left Shift**:</u>  | <<     | Shifts the bits of the operand to the left by a specified number of positions. This is equivalent to multiplying the number by 2 raised to the power of the shift count. | Shifts bits to the left (multiplies by 2 for each shift).      |
| <u>**Right Shift**</u>  | >>     | Shifts the bits of the operand to the right by a specified number of positions. This is equivalent to dividing the number by 2 raised to the power of the shift count.   | Shifts bits to the right (divides by 2 for each shift)         |
|                         |        |

# Basic Bit Operations

|                    |                                                    |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **_Set a bit_**    | Turn a specific bit to 1.                          |
| **_Clear a bit_**  | Turn a specific bit to 0.                          |
| **_Toggle a bit_** | Flip a specific bit (change 0 to 1 or vice versa). |
| **_Check a bit_**  | Determine if a specific bit is 1 or 0.             |
|                    |                                                    |
