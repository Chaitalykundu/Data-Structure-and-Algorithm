# Bit

A bit is defined as the basic unit which stores the data in digital notation.

Two values represent it as follows -

- 0 - It indicates the signal is absent or False
- 1 - It indicates the signal is present or True

Bits represent the **logical state** of any instruction.

The series of bits have a base which is 2. Thus if we say if we have a series of binary digits, it is read from left to right, and the power of 2 increases.

# Bit manipulation

Bit manipulation is defined as performing some basic operations on bit level of n number of digits.

Bit Manipulation is a technique in computer programming where operations are performed on individual bits of binary numbers.

It is a speedy and primitive method as it directly works at the machine end.

# Common Bit Manipulation Operations:

- **Bitwise AND (&)**: Performs a logical AND operation on each pair of corresponding bits. The result is 1 only if both bits are 1, otherwise, it is 0.

- **Bitwise OR (|)**: Performs a logical OR operation on each pair of corresponding bits. The result is 1 if at least one bit is 1, otherwise, it is 0.

- **Bitwise XOR (^)**: Performs a logical XOR (exclusive OR) operation on each pair of corresponding bits. The result is 1 if the bits are different, otherwise, it is 0.

- **Bitwise NOT (~)**: Flips the bits of the operand, changing 0 to 1 and 1 to 0.

- **Left Shift (<<)**: Shifts the bits of the operand to the left by a specified number of positions. This is equivalent to multiplying the number by 2 raised to the power of the shift count.

- **Right Shift (>>)**: Shifts the bits of the operand to the right by a specified number of positions. This is equivalent to dividing the number by 2 raised to the power of the shift count.
