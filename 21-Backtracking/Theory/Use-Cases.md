# Use Cases of Backtracking

- N queen problems
- Subset/Subsequence Generation
- Sudoku Solver
- Maze / Path finding
- Permutations and Combinations
- Graph coloring

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

# N-Queens Problem

### Problem

Placing N queens on an NxN chessboard such that no two queens threaten each other.

&nbsp;

### Use Case

Backtracking can systematically explore different positions for queens and backtrack when conflicts arise, finding all possible solutions.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

# Subset/Subsequence Generation

### Problem

Generating all possible subsets or subsequences of a given set or string.

### Use Case

Backtracking can be used to explore different choices of including or excluding elements, generating all subsets or subsequences efficiently.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

# Sudoku Solver

### Problem

Filling in an incomplete Sudoku grid while satisfying all constraints of the game.

&nbsp;

### Use Case

Backtracking can systematically fill the empty cells of the grid, checking constraints at each step and backtracking when a solution is not possible.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

# Maze/Path Finding

### Problem

Finding a path from a starting point to an ending point in a maze while obeying certain rules or avoiding obstacles.

&nbsp;

### Use Case

Backtracking can explore different directions at each step, backtrack when a dead end is reached, and find a valid path through the maze.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

# Permutations and Combinations

### Problem

Generating all possible permutations or combinations of a given set of elements.

&nbsp;

### Use Case

Backtracking can systematically explore different choices for each position in the permutation or combination, generating all possibilities efficiently.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

# Graph Coloring

### Problem

Assigning colors to the vertices of a graph such that no two adjacent vertices have the same color.

&nbsp;

### Use Case

Backtracking can try different colors for each vertex, checking if it violates any constraints, and backtrack when a valid coloring is not possible.
