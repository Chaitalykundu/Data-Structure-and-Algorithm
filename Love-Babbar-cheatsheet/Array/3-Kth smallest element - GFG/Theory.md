- A Heap is a special Tree-based data structure in which the tree is a **_complete binary tree_**.

* A complete binary tree is a binary tree in which all the levels are completely filled except possibly the lowest one, which is filled from the left.

&nbsp;

# Operations of Heap Data Structure:

- <u>**_Heapify_**</u>: a process of creating a heap from an array.

- <u>**_Insertion_**</u>: process to insert an element in existing heap time complexity O(log N).

- <u>**_Deletion_**</u>: deleting the top element of the heap or the highest priority element, and then organizing the heap and returning the element with time complexity O(log N).

- <u>**_Peek_**</u>: to check or find the most prior element in the heap, (max or min element for max and min heap).

&nbsp;

# Types of Heap Data Structure

Generally, Heaps can be of **two** types:

- <u>**_Min-Heap_**</u>: In a Min-Heap the key present at the root node must be **_minimum_** among the keys present at all of it’s children.

- <u>**_Max-Heap_**</u>: In a Max-Heap the key present at the root node must be **_greatest_** among the keys present at all of it’s children.

# Identification of heap

1. k element
2. smallest / largest

- k + smallest = maxheap
- k + largest = minheap
