# Problem Statement

Given two integers a and b (where b ≠ 0). The objective is to find:

• The floor of the division a / b, denoted as ⌊a / b⌋ — the greatest integer less than or equal to a / b.

• The ceil of the division a / b, denoted as ⌈a / b⌉ — the smallest integer greater than or equal to a / b.

# Examples

## Example 1

- Input: a = 5, b = 3
- Output: [1, 2]
- Explanation: 5 / 3 = 1.66..., so floor is 1 and ceil is 2.

## Example 2

- Input: a = -7, b = 2
- Output: [-4, -3]
- Explanation: -7 / 2 = -3.5, so floor is -4 and ceil is -3.
